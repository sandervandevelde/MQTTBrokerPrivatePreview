## Capabilities available in this preview
This private preview provides the following capabilities
- Cloud MQTT broker functionality in Event Grid enabling publish and subscribe on flexible topic structure: support of wildcards in topic structure to allow subscription to filtered messages
- MQTT v3.1.1 compliance: 
	- Persistent sessions ensure that the messages are preserved for a certain time and sent to clients that disconnect and reconnect
	- Limitations:  LWT, Retain messages, Message ordering and QoS 2 are not supported. [Learn more](#mqttv311-level-of-support-and-limitations) 
- MQTT v5 compliance, below are some key features we support: 
	- User Properties on publish packet: Allows you to add additional information on publish packets to provide more context about the message.
	- Message Expiry Interval: You can set the message expiry interval (seconds) for each PUBLISH message and the message is stored by the broker for the defined period of time for any subscribing clients that are not connected currently.
	- Negative Acknowledgements:  Server can notify the publishing client, if the server cannot currently process the message, along with the reason.
	- Server-sent disconnect packet:  Server communicates the reason (in most scenarios) for disconnect to the client, to help client handle the disconnect better.
	- Topic Aliases:  Helps reduce the size of published packets by reducing the size of the topic field, making the data transfer more efficient.
	- Maximum message size:  The client can now tell the server the maximum message size the client can receive and any messages larger than this are dropped by the server.
	- Request-response:  We support response topic and correlation data properties on publish packet allowing clients to model request-response over MQTT per specification.
	- Flow control:  Helps adjust the message flow depending on device capabilities such as processing speed or storage capabilities by limiting number of QoS 1 messages to be dispatched to it simultaneously.
	- Clean Start and Session Expiry
	- Limitations:  LWT, Retain messages, Message ordering, QoS 2, Session Expiry, Shared subscriptions, Subscription IDs, Auth packet, and Assigned Client ID are not supported. [Learn more](https://github.com/Azure/MQTTBrokerPrivatePreview#mqttv5-level-of-support-and-limitations)
- QoS 0, 1: QoS 0 level guarantees a best-effort delivery. QoS1 guarantees that the message will be delivered at least once.
- Flexible access control model:  Grouping clients into ClientGroups and topic references into TopicSpaces to ease access control management.  See the [concepts](#concepts) section for a fuller description of all functionality
- Fine-grained access control model:  Introducing TopicTemplates with variables support to enable fine-grained access control.
- Support for one-one, one-many, many-one messaging patterns to accommodate for a variety of scenarios
- Compatibility with standard MQTT client libraries (ex. Eclipse Paho) allows users to migrate configuration much faster
- Route MQTT messages through Event Grid subscriptions to integrate data with Azure services or custom endpoints for flexibility to further process the data
- Support for TLS 1.2 endpoints for data plane operations to keep the data transmission secure
- Also, see [throttle limit tables](#mqtt-messages-limits) below

## Prerequisites

- We will enable the feature for the subscription ID you shared in the sign up form. If you haven't responded, please fill out this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbRxdDENSpgZtIq581m55eAQpURURXNEw4UkpTOEdNVTVXSllLQVhBUUo0US4u)

- You can use any ARM client or the [Azure Portal experience](/Azure%20Portal/README.md) to deploy the service's resources and any compliant MQTT client to test the service. However, this guide will only provide commands and scripts using [Azure CLI](/Azure%20CLI/README.md) for deploying resouces and Paho client in python for testing in Ubuntu. Follow these steps to take advantage of the provided instructions: 
	1. Use any Linux environment for testing.
		- To easily install and run Linux on Windows, run `wsl --install -d Ubuntu`. After installation is complete, you can run `wsl` to start running commands on your Ubuntu subsystem whenever you open a new terminal window. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)
	2. Clone this repository to any directory in your Linux environment: `git clone https://github.com/Azure/MQTTBrokerPrivatePreview.git`
	3. Follow the instructions in the [Environment_configuration README](/Environment_configuration/README.md) to register Azure CLI and set common variables for resources deployment.
	4. Follow the instructions in the [Python README](https://github.com/Azure/MQTTBrokerPrivatePreview/tree/main/python#azure-mqtt-broker-sample-python-instructions) to be able to test the scenarios.
	5. Navigate to each of the scenario folders and follow its README.md instructions to run the scenario.

- To connect to the new MQTT broker functionality in Event Grid, the clients must be authenticated using X.509 certificates. Clients can be authenticated using a CA-signed certificate or a self-signed certificate.  Please see the [client authentication section](#client-authentication). You can use your own certificates or the certificate generation script provided in this guide and referenced in the scenarios' instructions.

- To route your messages from your clients to different Azure services or your custom endpoint, an Event Grid topic needs to be created and referenced during namespace creation to forward the messages to that topic for routing; this reference cannot be added/updated afterwards. [Scenario4](/Scenario4_Route%20MQTT%20data%20through%20Event%20Grid%20subscription) showcases an example of the configuration to take advantage of the routing functionality and the [Routing and Namespace sections of the generic Azure CLI instructions](https://github.com/Azure/MQTTBrokerPrivatePreview/tree/main/Azure%20CLI#event-grid-topic) also provide instructions on the generic routing configuration.  


## QuickStart
Let us get started with a simple scenario, with a publisher and subscriber communicating on a topic. 

|Client | Role | Topic/Topic Filter|
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
|Pub_client | Publisher | samples/topic |
|Sub_client | Subscriber | samples/topic |

After following the instructions in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites), navigate to the Scenario0_Hello_World folder in your cloned repo through `cd ./MQTTBrokerPrivatePreview/Scenario0_Hello_World/`

Run the following commands to run the script, creating the resources: 
```bash
chmod 700 create_resources.sh
./create_resources.sh
```
To test the scenario:
1. If you haven't installed the required modules, follow the instructions in the [python README file](../python/README.md).
2. Make sure you have the `mqtt-broker` virtual environment activated by running `source ~/env/mqtt-broker/bin/activate` in Linux or `env/mqtt-broker/bin/activate` in Windows
3. In a terminal window, set up the following variable: `export gw_url="<namespace name>.southcentralus-1.ts.eventgrid.azure.net"` and run the sample script through the following command: `python ./subscribe.py`
4. In a different terminal window, set up the following variable: `export gw_url="<namespace name>.southcentralus-1.ts.eventgrid.azure.net"` and run the sample script through the following command: `python ./publish.py`


## Scenarios
Here are a few scenarios that showcase the functionality of the service. Follow the instructions in the [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites) to test these scenarios.

| # | Scenario | Description |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1 | Fan-out (one-to-many) messages  | This scenario simulates cloud-to-client commands to several clients and can be leveraged for use cases such as sending alerts to clients. Consider the use case where a fleet management service needs to send a weather alert to all the vehicles in the fleet. For instructions see [README](/Scenario1_Fan-Out/README.md).  |
| 2 | Fan-in (many to one) messaging  | This scenario simulates publishing messages from multiple clients to a single client.  Consider a use case where one needs to identify location of vehicles on a map.  For instructions see [README](/Scenario2_Fan-In/README.md). |
| 3 | One to one messaging  | This scenario simulates publishing messages from one client to another.  Consider a use case where a user can unlock their car from a mobile app.  For instructions see [README](/Scenario3_One-to-One/README.md).  |
| 4 | Route MQTT data through Event Grid subscription  | This scenario showcases how to configure route to send filtered messages from MQTT to the endpoint: Event Hubs through EG subscription.  Consider a use case where one needs to identify location of vehicles.  For instructions see [README](/Scenario4_EventGrid_Routing/README.md).  |

## Terminology
Some of the key terms relevant for private preview are explained below.

| Term| Definition |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| MQTT Broker| An MQTT broker is an intermediary entity that enables MQTT clients to communicate. Specifically, an MQTT broker receives messages published by clients, filters the messages by topic, and distributes them to subscribers. |
| Namespace| A namespace is a declarative space that provides a scope to the resources (certificates, clients, client groups, topic spaces, permission bindings, etc.) inside it.  Namespaces are used to organize the resources into logical groups. |
| Client| Client can be a device or a service that will publish and/or subscribe MQTT messages |
| Certificate / Cert| Certificate is a form of asymmetric credential. They are a combination of a public key from an asymmetric keypair and a set of metadata describing the valid uses of the keypair.  If the keypair of the issuer is the same keypair as the certificate, the certificate is said to be "self-signed". Third-party certificate issuers are sometimes called Certificate Authorities (CA). |
| Client attributes| Client attributes represent a set of key-value pairs that provide descriptive information about the client.  Client attributes are used in creating client groups and as variables in Topic Templates.   For example, client type is an attribute that provides the client's type. |
| Client group| Client group is a collection of clients that are grouped by a set of common client attribute(s) using a query string, and could be allowed to publish and/or subscribe to a specific Topic Spaces |
| Topic spaces | Topic spaces is a set of topic templates (defined below). It is used to simplify access control management by enabling you to grant publish or subscribe access to a group of topics at once instead of individual topics. |
| Topic filter| An MQTT topic filter is an MQTT topic that can include wildcards for one or more of its segments, allowing it to match multiple MQTT topics. It is used to simplify subscriptions declarations as one topic filter can match multiple topics. |
| Topic template| Topic templates are an extension of the topic filter that supports variables. It is used for fine-grained access control within a client group. |
| Permission bindings| A Permission Binding grants access to a specific client group to either publish or subscribe on a specific topic spaces.  |

## Concepts

### Namespace
A namespace is a declarative space that provides a scope to all the nested resources such as certificates, clients, client groups, topic spaces, permission bindings, etc. inside it.  Namespaces are used to organize the resources into logical groups.  Creating the namespace instantiates the MQTT broker.  Namespace is a tracked resource with 'tags' and a 'location' properties, and once created can be found on resources.azure.com.

### Client Authentication
For private preview, we will be supporting authentication of clients using X.509 certificates.  X.509 certificate will provide the credentials to associate a particular client with the tenant, and at the same time, ensure the communication is encrypted.  In this model, authentication generally happens once during session establishment.  Then, all future operations using the same session are assumed to come from that identity. 
The following credential types are supported:
- Certificates issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) 
- Self-signed certificates

**CA signed certificates:**  In this method, a root or intermediate X.509 certificate is registered with the service.  Essentially, the root or intermediary certificate that is used to sign the client certificate, must be registered with the service first.  Later, clients are authenticated if they have a valid leaf certificate that's signed by the root or intermediate certificate that was supplied to the service.  While registering the clients, the subject common name of the leaf certificate needs to be supplied for authentication. Service will validate the subject values match the subject values from the client certificate and also validate the client certificate is signed the root or intermediary certificate that was registered earlier.  

**Self-signed certificates:**  For self-signed certificates, clients are onboarded to the service using the certificate thumbprint alongside the identity record. In this method of authentication, the client registry will store the exact ID of the certificate that the client is going to use to authenticate. 

One and only one authentication type properties (CertificateThumbprint or CertificateSubject) must be provided in the Create/Update Payload for Client.

### Client Groups
Client group is a new concept introduced to make management of client access controls (publish/subscribe) easy – multiple clients can be grouped together based on certain commonalities to provide similar levels of authorization to publish and/or subscribe to Topic spaces.

Clients can be devices or applications, such as devices or vehicles that send/receive MQTT messages. We provide a default client group, named $all, which all clients are associated with. For ease of testing, you can considering using $all for premissions.

For example, a fleet management company with hundreds of trucks and other shipment delivery vehicles across the country, can improve their routing, tracking, driver safety and predictable maintenance capabilities by sending and receiving MQTT messages to/from the vehicles to/from monitoring applications on cloud.

In this scenario, vehicles can be configured as clients that publish/subscribe to various topics such as weather information, road conditions, geo location, engine performance and other wear-and-tear aspects of the vehicle.  And, while configuring the vehicle as a client, a set of attributes such as vehicle type, year, make & model, max load capacity can also be included as part of the client metadata via client attributes.

These client attributes can be used to create the client groups.  For example, if the vehicles that can carry loads over 2 tons are prone to accidents if driven with low braking fluid, in icy road conditions, then all such vehicles can be grouped together to continuously monitor and alert the drivers in case of potential hazardous conditions based on weather at their locations.

### Client group considerations:
The main purpose of client groups is to provide common authorization to a set of clients to either publish and/or subscribe on one or more Topic spaces.  Every client needs to be part of a client group to be able to publish and subscribe on topic spaces.  The goal is to keep the quantity of client groups very small to make permissions manageable.

For this preview, we will be supporting a maximum of 10 client groups per namespace.

While grouping clients, please ensure that it's easier to reuse the group to publish and subscribe across multiple topic spaces.  To this end, it is important to think through the end-to-end scenarios to identify the topics every client will publish to and subscribe to.  We recommend identifying the commonalities across the scenarios, to avoid over fragmentation of client groups and topic spaces.  Set the client attributes generic enough to achieve simple grouping and avoid highly complex group queries.

**What are client attributes?**
Client attributes are a set of user defined key-value pairs or tags that provide information about the client.  These attributes will be the main ingredient in the client group filtering expressions.  Attributes could be describing the physical or functional characteristics of the client.  Typical attribute could be type of the client (client type).  
Here is an example:
- Type: Values could be "sensor" or "thermostat" or "vehicle"

Here’s a sample schema for the attribute definition: 

```bash
{  
    "id": "device123",  
    "attributes": {  
        "type": "home-sensors",
        "sensors": ["motion", "noise", "light"]  
     }  
}
```

While configuring the client attributes, consider the topics that the clients will be publishing (subscribing) to.  Thinking backwards from topics to clients will help identifying the commonalities across client roles much easier and defining the client attributes to make the client grouping effortless.  

**How to create client group queries?**
To setup a client group, user needs to build a query that filters a set of clients based on their attribute values.

Here are a few sample queries:
- (attributes.sensors = "motion" or attributes.sensors = "humidity") or attributes.type = "home-sensors"
- attributes.sensors IN ["motion", "humidity", "temperature"] and attributes.floor <= 5

In group queries, following operands are allowed:
- Equality operator "="
- Not equal operator in 2 forms "<>" and "!=" 
- Less than "<", greater than ">", less than equal to "<=", greater than equal to ">=" for long integer values
- "IN" to compare with a set of values

Please refer to the [naming considerations table](#naming-considerations) for details on allowed characters and patterns.


### Topic Spaces
A topic space is a set of topic templates (defined below). It is used to simplify access control management by enabling you to grant publish or subscribe access to a group of topics at once instead of individual topics.  
It is important to note that the publishing is a supported action on all topic spaces by default; however, you need to configure the subscription support as detailed below.

#### Topic filter:
An [MQTT topic filter](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html#_Toc398718106) is an MQTT topic that can include wildcards for one or more of its segments, allowing it to match multiple MQTT topics. It is used to simplify subscriptions declarations as one topic filter can match multiple topics.

The service supports all the MQTT wildcards defined by the [MQTT specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html#_Toc398718107) as follows:
- +: which matches a single segment.
	- E.g. topic filter: "machines/+/alert" will match the following topics:
		- machines/temp/alert
		- machines/humidity/alert
- #: which matches zero or more segments at the end of the topic. 
	- E.g. topic filter: "machines/#" will match the following topics:
		- machines
		- machines/temp
		- machines/humidity
		- machines/temp/alert etc

See [Topic Wilcards](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html#_Toc398718107) from the MQTT spec for more details.

#### Topic template: 
Topic templates are an extension of the topic filter that supports variables. It is used for fine-grained access control within a client group. You can provide access to a client group to publish or subscribe on a topic space with multiple topic templates. If any of the topic templates include a variable, only the clients associated with this variable will have access to the corresponding topic.

For example, you can provide access to client group "machines" to the topic space "machinesTelemetry" that includes the topic template "machines/${client.name}/temp". Only the machine with client name = machine1 will be able to publish on topic "machines/machine1/temp", and only the machine with client name = machine2 will be able to publish on topic "machines/machine2/temp", and so on. This prevents machine2 from publishing false information on behalf of machine1, even though it has access to the same topic space, and vice versa. 

##### Supported variables:
- ${client.name}: this variable represents the name of the client assigned during client creation.
- ${client.attributes.x}: this variable represents any of the assigned attributes to a client during client creation/update, so as "x" would be equal to the exact string of the attribute key. Read more about client attributes in the Terminology section.

**Note:** A variable can represent a portion of a segment or an entire segment but cannot cover more than one segment. E.g. a topic template could include "machines/${client.name|.factory1}/temp" will match topics "machines/machine1.factory1/temp", "machines/machine2.factory1/temp", etc

#### Subscription support:
Subscription support is used to optimize the service’s mode of  message delivery to your clients based on your scenario. There are three modes: 
- Not supported: will indicate that topic space could be used only for publishing. This will be helpful in scenarios when you expect your corresponding topic templates to overlap since this is the only mode that will allow your topic templates to overlap with any other topic template.
- Low fanout: will specify a subscription delivery mode optimized for having a maximum of 10 subscribers per topic, with very low latency. 
	- Example scenario: There is a group of vehicles with each vehicle subscribing to its own command delivered to its own topic.
- High fanout: will specify a subscription delivery mode optimized for having unlimited number of subscribers per topic, with higher latency.
	- Example scenario: There is a large group of vehicles in a city subscribing to the same weather alerts that get broadcasted on the same topic.

#### Topic space considerations
- **Default Behavior:**
To publish or subscribe to any topic, a matching topic space must be configured, and a permission binding needs to be set for the client group(s) that include the clients that need publish/subscribe access to this topic space. 
- **Topic templates Overlap:**
If you set your topic space with a low fanout or high fanout subscription modes, the corresponding topic templates cannot overlap with each other, but they can overlap with a topic space with "not supported" subscription support. The overlap exists if a topic could match more than one topic template: 
	- Examples:
		- "machines/${client.name}/temp" and "machines/+/temp" overlap because the second template covers the first one via wildcard. 
		- vehicles/vehicle1/telemetry/# and vehicles/${client.name}/telemetry/# conflict because in the second template the segment with variable is treated as single level wildcard + and hence, covers the first topic template. PublishOnly topic spaces can overlap with LowFanout topic spaces.
- **Configuration:**
	- Topic templates use special characters $ and | and these need to be escaped differently based on the shell being used. In PowerShell, $ can be escaped with vehicles/${dollar}telemetry/#. If you’re using PowerShell, you can accomplish this as shown in the examples below: 
		- '"vehicles/${client.name|dollar}/#"'
		- 'vehicles/${client.name"|"dollar}/#'
	- Subscription support is immutable. To reconfigure the subscription support, delete the topic space and create a new topic space with the desired subscription support.
	- Topic space updates may take up to 5 minutes to propagate.


### Access Control

Client Groups and Topic Spaces are designed to simplify access control. Consider the following as you design Client Groups and Topic Spaces: 
- Group a set of clients into 'Client Groups' such that each Client Group represents the clients that need the same access to publish and/or subscribe to the same set of topics.
- Group a set of Topic Templates into 'Topic Spaces' such that each Topic Space represents messages meant for the same audience (a specific Client Group).

Examples:

The following examples detail how to configure the access control model based on the following requirements. 

- Example 1:

    A factory has multiple areas with each area including machines that need to communicate with each other. However, machines from other areas of the factory are not allowed to communicate with them.

	| Client  | Role  | Topic/Topic Filter  |
	| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
	|Area1_Machine1| Publisher| areas/area1/machines/machine1|
	|Area1_Machine2| Subscriber| areas/area1/machines/#|
	|Area2_Machine1| Publisher| areas/area2/machines/machine1|
	|Area2_Machine2| Subscriber| areas/area2/machines/#|

- Configuration
	- Create a Client Group for each factory area’s machines.
	- Create a Topic Space for each area representing the topics that the area’s machines will communicate over.
	- Create 2 Permission Bindings for each area’s Client Group to publish and subscribe to its corresponding area’s Topic Space.


	|Client| Client Group| Permission Binding| Topic Space|
	| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
	|Area1_Machine1| Area1Machines| Area1-Pub| Area1Messages -Topic Template: areas/area1/machines/#|
	|Area1_Machine2| Area1Machines| Area1-Sub| Area1Messages -Topic Template: areas/area1/machines/#|
	|Area2_Machine1| Area2Machines| Area2-Pub| Area2Messages -Topic Template: areas/area2/machines/#|
	|Area2_Machine2| Area2Machines| Area2-Sub| Area2Messages -Topic Template: areas/area2/machines/#|

- Example 2:

    Let’s assume an extra requirement for the example above: each area has management nodes along with the machines, and the machines must not have publish access in case any of them gets compromised. On the other hand, the management nodes need publish access to send commands to the machines and subscribe access to receive telemetry from the machines.

	| Client | Role | Topic/Topic Filter | 
	| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
	| Area1_Machine1 | Publisher | areas/area1/machines/machine1
	|| Subscriber | areas/area1/mgmt/# | 
	| Area1_Mgmt1 | Publisher | areas/area1/mgmt/machine1
	|| Subscriber | areas/area1/machines/# | 
	| Area2_Machine1 | Publisher | areas/area2/machines/machine1
	| |Subscriber | areas/area2/mgmt/# | 
	| Area2_ Mgmt1 | Publisher | areas/area2/mgmt/machine1 | 
	||Subscriber | areas/area2/machines/# |

- Configuration:
	- Create 2 Client Groups per area: one for the management nodes and another for the machines.
	- Create 2 Topic Spaces for each area: one representing telemetry topics and another representing commands topics.
	- Create 2 Permission Bindings for each area’s management nodes to publish to the commands Topic Space and subscribe to the telemetry Topic Space.
	- Create 2 Permission Bindings for each area’s machines to subscribe to the commands Topic Space and publish to the telemetry Topic Space.


	|Client | Client Group | Permission Binding | Topic/Topic Filter|
	| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
	|Area1_Machine1 | Area1Machines | Area1Machines-Pub | Area1Telemetry -Topic Template: areas/area1/machines/#|
	| |  | Area1Machines-Sub | Area1Commands -Topic Template: areas/area1/mgmt/#|
	|Area1_MgmtClient1 | Area1Mgmt | Area1Mgmt-Pub | Area1Commands -Topic Template: areas/area1/mgmt/#|
	| |  | Area1Mgmt-Sub | Area1Telemetry -Topic Template: areas/area1/machines/#|
	|Area2_Machine1 | Area2Machines | Area2Machines-Pub | Area2Telemetry -Topic Template: areas/area2/machines/#|
	| |  | Area2Machines-Sub | Area2Commands -Topic Template: areas/area2/mgmt/#|
	|Area2_ MgmtClient1 | Area2Mgmt | Area2Mgmt-Pub | Area2Commands -Topic Template: areas/area2/mgmt/#|
	| |  | Area2Mgmt-Sub | Area2Telemetry -Topic Template: areas/area2/machines/#|
 
### Routing
This functionality will enable you to route your messages from your clients to different Azure services like Event hubs, Service Bus, etc or your custom endpoint. This functionality is achieved through [Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/), by sending all your messages from your clients to an [Event Grid topic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/custom-topics), and using [Event Grid subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/subscribe-through-portal) to route the messages from that Event Grid topic to the [supported endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-handlers).

Event Grid is a highly scalable, serverless event broker that you can use to integrate applications using events. Events are delivered by Event Grid to subscriber destinations such as applications, Azure services, or any endpoint to which Event Grid has network access. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/)

**Note:**  To be able to take advantage of this feature, you have to either use the ARM template to create the Event Grid custom topic first and provide that topic’s ARM Id during the namespace creation.

[Scenario4](https://github.com/Azure/MQTTBrokerPrivatePreview/blob/main/Scenario4_EventGrid_Routing/README.md) showcases an example of taking advantage of the routing functionality and the [Routing and Namespace section of the generic Azure CLI instructions](https://github.com/Azure/MQTTBrokerPrivatePreview/tree/main/Azure%20CLI#event-grid-topic) also provides instructions on the routing configuration.  

#### How can I use the routing feature?
Routing the messages from your clients to an Azure service or your custom endpoint enables you to maximize the benefits of this data. The following are some of many use cases to take advantage of this feature:
- Data Analysis: extract and analyze the routed messags from your clients to optimize your solution. e.g. analyze your machines' telemetry to predict when to schedule maintenance before failures happen to avoid delays and further damage.
- Serverless applications: trigger a serverless function based on the routed messages from your clients. E.g. when a motion sensor detects a motion, send a notification to security personnel to address it.
- Data Visualizations: build visualizations of the routed data from your clients to easily represent and understand the data as well as highlight trends and outliers.

#### Routing Considerations:
- The Event grid topic that will be used for routing need to fulfil the following requirements:
	- It needs to be set to use the Cloud Event Schema v1.0
	- It needs to be in the same region as the namespace
	- You need to assign "EventGrid Data Sender" role to yourself on the Event Grid Topic.
		- In the portal, go to the created Event Grid topic resource. 
		- In the "Access control (IAM)" menu item, select "Add a role assignment".
		- In the "Role" tab, select "EventGrid Data Sender", then select "Next".
		- In the "Members" tab, click on "+Select members", then type your AD user name in the "Select" box that will appear (e.g. user@contoso.com).
		- Select your AD user name, then select "Review + assign"
> **Warning**

>  If you move the Event Grid Topic resource to a different resource group or subscription after configuration, the routing experience will not function as expected.

- **Filtering:**
	- You can use the Event Grid Subscription’s filtering capability to filter the routed messages based on the MQTT topic through filtering on the "subject" property in the Cloud Event schema. Event Grid Subscriptions supports free simple subject filtering by specifying a starting or ending value for the subject. For example, 
		- You can specify the subject ends with "gps" to only route messages reporting on location. 
		- You can filter the subject begins with "factory1/Area2/" to route only the messages that belong to facotry1 and area 2 to a specific endpoint and you can replicate this configuration to route messages from other factories/areas to different endpoints.
	- You can also take advantage of the [Event Subscription’s advanced filtering](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/event-filtering#advanced-filtering) to filter based on the MQTT topic through filtering on the subject property in the Cloud Event Schema. This enable you to set more complex filters by secifying a comparison operator, key, and value.

#### CloudEvent Schema for the routed MQTT messages:
MQTT Messages will be routed to the Event Grid Topic as CloudEvents according to the following logic:
- For MQTT v3 messages or MQTT v5 messages of a payload format indicator=0, the payload will be forwarded in the data_base64 object and encoded as a base 64 string according to the following schema sample.
MQTT v3 message:
```bash
{
   "specversion": "1.0",
   "id": "9aeb0fdf-c01e-0131-0922-9eb54906e20", // unique id stamped by the service
   "time": "2019-11-18T15:13:39.4589254Z", // timestamp when messages was received by the service
   "type": "MQTT.EventPublished", // set type for all MQTT messages enveloped by the service
   "source": "testnamespace", // namespace name
   "subject": "campus/buildings/building17", // topic of the MQTT publish request 
   "mqtttopic": " campus/buildings/building17" // topic of the MQTT publish request
   "data_base64": {
          IlRlbXAiOiAiNzAiLAoiaHVtaWRpdHkiOiAiNDAiCg==
  }
 }
 ```
MQTT v5 message with PFI=0:
```bash
{
   "specversion": "1.0",
   "id": "9aeb0fdf-c01e-0131-0922-9eb54906e20", // unique id stamped by the service
   "time": "2019-11-18T15:13:39.4589254Z", // timestamp when messages was received by the service
   "type": "MQTT.EventPublished", // set type for all MQTT messages enveloped by the service
   "source": "testnamespace", // namespace name
   "subject": "campus/buildings/building17", // topic of the MQTT publish request 
   "mqtttopic": " campus/buildings/building17" // topic of the MQTT publish request
   "mqttresponsetopic": "topic/response" // response topic of the MQTT publish request
   "mqttcorrelationdata": "cmVxdWVzdDE=" // correlation data of the MQTT publish request encoded in base64
   "mqttmessageexpiry": "2019-11-18T15:23:39.4589254Z" // message expiration timestamp based of the MQTT message expiry interval of the MQTT publish request
   "datacontenttype": "application/octet-stream" //content type of the MQTT publish request
   "data_base64": {
          IlRlbXAiOiAiNzAiLAoiaHVtaWRpdHkiOiAiNDAiCg==
  }
 }
```
- For MQTT v5 messages of content type= “application/json; charset=utf-8” or of a payload format indicator=1, the payload will be forwarded in the data object, and the message will be serialized as a JSON or a JSON string if the payload not a JSON. This will enable you to filter on your payload properties. For example, you would be able to add this filter for the following sample: "advancedFilters": [{"operatorType": "NumberGreaterThan","key": "data.Temp","value": 100}] 
```bash
{
   "specversion": "1.0",
   "id": "9aeb0fdf-c01e-0131-0922-9eb54906e20", // unique id stamped by the service
   "time": "2019-11-18T15:13:39.4589254Z", // timestamp when messages was received by the service
   "type": "MQTT.EventPublished", // set type for all MQTT messages enveloped by the service
   "source": "testnamespace", // namespace name
   "subject": "campus/buildings/building17", // topic of the MQTT publish request 
   "mqtttopic": " campus/buildings/building17" // topic of the MQTT publish request
   "mqttresponsetopic": "topic/response" // response topic of the MQTT publish request
   "mqttcorrelationdata": " cmVxdWVzdDE=" // correlation data of the MQTT publish request encoded in base64
   "mqttmessageexpiry": "2019-11-18T15:23:39.4589254Z" // message expiration timestamp based of the MQTT message expiry interval of the MQTT publish request
   "datacontenttype": "application/json" //content type of the MQTT publish request
   "data": {
         "Temp": "70",
         "humidity": "40"
  }
 }
 ```
- For MQTT v5 messages that are already enveloped in a CloudEvent according to the [MQTT Protocol Binding for CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/mqtt-protocol-binding.md) whether using the binary content mode or the structured content mode in JSON encoding (utf-8), the event will be forwarded with the original default CloudEvents attributes after enrichments according to the following schema sample.
```bash
{
  "specverion": "1.0",
  "id": "9aeb0fdf-c01e-0131-0922-9eb54906e20", // original id stamped by the client 
  "time": "2019-11-18T15:13:39.4589254Z", // timestamp when messages was received by the client
  "type": "Custom.Type", // original type value stamped by the client
  "source": "Custom.Source", // original source value stamped by the client
  "subject": " Custom.Subject", // original subjectvalue stamped by the client
   "mqtttopic": " campus/buildings/building17" // topic of the MQTT publish request
   "mqttresponsetopic": "topic/response" // response topic of the MQTT publish request
   "mqttcorrelationdata": " cmVxdWVzdDE=" // correlation data of the MQTT publish request encoded in base64
   "mqttmessageexpiry": "2019-11-18T15:23:39.4589254Z" // message expiration timestamp based of the MQTT message expiry interval of the MQTT publish request
   "datacontenttype": "application/json" //content type of the MQTT publish request
   "data": {
         "Temp": "70",
         "humidity": "40"
  }
 }
```
- For MQTT v5 messages, user properties that meet [the requirements for compliant event attributes](https://github.com/Azure/MQTTBrokerPrivatePreview/blob/main/README.md#requirements-for-compliant-event-attributes) will be forwarded as a CloudEvent attribute, but user properties that don’t meet the requirements will be forwarded as a JSON string value to the attribute “mqttuserproperties” according to the following sample.
```bash
{
   "specversion": "1.0",
   "id": "9aeb0fdf-c01e-0131-0922-9eb54906e20", // unique id stamped by the service
   "time": "2019-11-18T15:13:39.4589254Z", // timestamp when messages was received by the service
   "type": "MQTT.EventPublished", // set type for all MQTT messages enveloped by the service
   "source": "testnamespace", // namespace name
   "subject": "campus/buildings/building17", // topic of the MQTT publish request 
   "mqtttopic": " campus/buildings/building17" // topic of the MQTT publish request
   "mqttresponsetopic": "topic/response" // response topic of the MQTT publish request
   "mqttcorrelationdata": " cmVxdWVzdDE=" // correlation data of the MQTT publish request encoded in base64
   "mqttmessageexpiry": "2019-11-18T15:23:39.4589254Z" // message expiration timestamp based of the MQTT message expiry interval of the MQTT publish request
   "datacontenttype": "application/json" //content type of the MQTT publish request
   "priority": "2", // user property that meets the requirements for compliant event attributes
   "mqttuserproperties": "{\"Bldg-Region\":\"Redmond\",\"type\":\"room \"}", // user properties that don’t meet the requirements for compliant event attributes
   "data": {
         "Temp": "70",
         "humidity": "40"
  }
 }
```
##### Requirements for Compliant Event Attributes:
Since routed messages are enveloped in a CloudEvent and the service applies the default enrichments, custom enrichments through user properties should fulfil the following requirements:
- Only lower-case alphanumerics: only (a-z) and (0-9)
- Properties should not clash with the CloudEvent’s default or extension attributes: 
	- Default attributes: specversion, id, time, type, source, subject, datacontenttype, dataschema, data
	- Extension attributes: dataref, traceparent, tracestate, partitionkey, value, sequence, or sequencetype
- Enrichments shoud not start with “mqtt” as these prefixes are reserved for MQTT properties.
- There should not be 2 enrichments with the same key. 

## Limitations
### MQTTv3.1.1 Level of Support and Limitations
MQTT v3.1.1 support is limited in following ways:
- Will Message is not supported yet. Receiving a CONNECT request with Will Message will result in a connection failure.
- QoS2 and Retain Flag are not supported yet. A publish request with a retain flag or with a QoS2 will fail and close the connection.
- Message ordering is not guaranteed.
- Keep Alive Maximum is 1160 seconds. 
### MQTTv5 Level of Support and Limitations
MQTT v5 support is limited in following ways (communicated to client via CONNACK properties unless explicitly noted otherwise):
- Shared Subscriptions are not supported yet.
- Retain flag is not supported yet.
- Will Message is not supported yet. Receiving a CONNECT request with Will Message will result in CONNACK with 0x83 (Implementation specific error).
- Maximum QoS is 1.
- Maximum Packet Size is 512 KiB
- Message ordering is not guaranteed.
- Subscription Identifiers are not supported.
- Assigned Client Identifiers are not supported yet.
- Client-specified Session Expiry is not supported. The server will override any Session Expiry Interval value coming in the  CONNECT request (other than 0) with a fixed expiry interval (3600) in the CONNACK’s Session Expiry Interval property.
- Since the only supported authentication mode is through certificates, the server will respond to a CONNECT request with either Authentication Method or Authentication Data with a CONNACK with code 0x8C (Bad authentication method) or 0x87 (Not Authorized) respectively. 
- Topic Alias Maximum is 10. The server will not assign any topic aliases for outgoing messages at this time. Clients can assign and use topic aliases within set limit. 
- CONNACK doesn't return Response Information property even if the  CONNECT request contains Request Response Information property.
- If the server recieves a PUBACK from a client with non-success response code, the connection will be terminated.
- Keep Alive Maximum is 1160 seconds.

## Frequently asked questions 
- Is Azure monitoring metrics and logging available? 
	- Not in this release.  We will add monitoring metrics and diagnostic logs in the next release.
- What happens if client attempts to publish on a topic when a matching topic space is not found? 
	- Client connection will be closed. Identify which client groups the client belongs to.  Based on the permission bindings, identify the topic spaces to which the client groups have access to publish.
- How do I connect an MQTT client that requires username and password for authentication?
	- Username and password based authentication is not supported in this release.  It will be supported in a future release.
- What happens if I have more than 10 subscribers per topic for a low fanout topic space?
    - In this release, the 11th subscription request for the same topic will be rejected.
- How do Azure IoT Hub and Azure Event Grid compare?
    - While Azure IoT Hub and Azure Event Grid (with new MQTT Broker capability) enable messaging between devices and services, that are necessary for IoT solutions, there are some key differences. Both services support device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device communication but Event Grid also enables device-to-device communication, via the cloud MQTT Broker. IoT Hub provides richer device management and bulk-device provisioning through integration with Azure Device Provisioning Service. In terms of protocols Event Grid supports HTTP & MQTT and IoT Hub supports HTTP, MQTT & AMQP. For messaging use cases using MQTT protocol, you can start with Azure Event Grid. If your solution requires bulk device provisioning and device management, then you can start with Azure IoT Hub. In future, Azure Event Grid will integrate with Azure Device Provisioning Service to enable these bulk provisioning capabilities.
